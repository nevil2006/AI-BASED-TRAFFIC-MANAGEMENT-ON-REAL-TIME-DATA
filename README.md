# AI-Based Traffic Management on Real-Time Data

## Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent traffic management system that utilizes artificial intelligence and real-time data to optimize traffic flow at intersections. By analyzing live traffic data, the system dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings to reduce congestion and improve overall traffic efficiency.

## Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Analysis**: Utilizes computer vision techniques to assess live traffic conditions.
- **Dynamic Signal Control**: Adjusts traffic light durations based on current traffic density.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be deployed across multiple intersections and adapt to various traffic scenarios.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nevil2006/AI-BASED-TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-ON-REAL-TIME-DATA.git
   cd AI-BASED-TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-ON-REAL-TIME-DATA
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configure the System**:
   - Set up any necessary configuration files or environment variables as specified in the documentation.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Connect to live traffic cameras or video feeds to gather real-time traffic data.

2. **Running the System**:
   - Execute the main application script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - The system will start analyzing the traffic data and adjust signal timings accordingly.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Use the provided dashboard or logging system to monitor traffic conditions and system performance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the machine learning framework used)
- Additional libraries as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Contributing
